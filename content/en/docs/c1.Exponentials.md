Exponentials are most commonly used in the context of complex numbers but they also play a crucial role in modelling the behaviour of various components. This includes capacitors, bjts (a type of transistor) and diodes (a component that only lets current flow in 1 direction).

## Buck Converters

One practical application of exponential behaviour is found in buck converters. They use various components to step the input voltage down to a lower value which is useful for phone charging. To charge a battery safely, we need the current to be constant even as the battery voltage fluctuates from about 3.2V at 0% to 4.2V at 100%. This change will lead to the charging current decreasing so we can use a buck converter and a control loop to convert excess input voltage into current which maintains the constant current that we are after.

The buck converter works by rapidly opening and closing the switch to control the current flowing into the inductor which creates a voltage across the inductor (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mi>V</mi>
    <mi>t</mi>
  <mo>=</mo>
    <mi>L</mi>
    <mi>i</mi>
</math>
). The longer we keep the switch closed, inductor voltage decreases because as we can see from the diagram, voltage across the inductor = Vin - Vout so as the inductor voltage comes closer to 0, Vout increases to become closer to Vin. This tells us that we can control our output voltage by doing two things, either changing the input voltage or changing the amount of time that the switch is closed. We use the latter to implement a control loop that measures the ouput current and changes the on time of the switch (amount of time that the switch is closed) to ensure that the current stays constant.

When we open the switch, the inductor current discharges through the battery and the capacitor helps to maintain a stable output voltage by providing extra current when the inductor current drops and by absorbing excess current when the inductor current increases. The problem with a capacitor is that any sort of series resistance will cause it to discharge and cause the ouput voltage to drop. This discharging is modelled by an exponential equation - <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <msub>
    <mi>V</mi>
    <mi>out</mi>
  </msub>
  <mo>=</mo>
  <msub>
    <mi>V</mi>
    <mi>stable</mi>
  </msub>
  <mo>&#8290;</mo>
  <msup>
    <mi>e</mi>
    <mrow>
      <mo>-</mo>

        <mi>t</mi>
        <mi>RC</mi>
      </mfrac>
    </mrow>
  </msup>
</math>. We can easily see that if t = RC (R is the resitance and C is the capacitance), Vout decreases by <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <msup>
    <mi>e</mi>
    <mn>-1</mn>
  </msup>
  <mo>= ~</mo>
  <mn>36.8</mn>
  <mo>%</mo>
</math>. If we want to make it so that there is only a 5% discharge then we would need the time constant to be ~7x larger than the off time of the switch. 

Due to a multitude of different reasons, mainly to do with efficiency, it is better to have a low series resistance to the capacitor which means the only way to decrease the impact of this discharge is to increase the capacitor value. This then slows down the ability of the control loop to respond so you would use this maths, the control loop maths and experience and intuition to select a good capacitor value that gives you a fast, stable system with smooth output voltage.

## Frequency Plots

Logarithms are mainly just something useful to know as they are the inverse of an exponential but there is a specific case where they make life considerably easier. This is in something called bode plots which allow us to plot what frequencies a filter blocks and which ones it lets through. We know that the equation representing a low pass filter is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mfrac>
    <mn>1</mn>
    <mrow>
      <mn>1</mn>
      <mo>+</mo>
      <mfrac>
        <mi>s</mi>
        <msub>
        <mi>w</mi>
        <mi>c</mi>
        </msub>
      </mfrac>
    </mrow>
  </mfrac>
</math>. When the frequency is larger than the cutoff frequency, we can make the approximation that the signal is attenuated (reduced) by <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mfrac>
    <mn>1</mn>
    <mrow>
      <mfrac>
        <mi>s</mi>
        <msub>
        <mi>w</mi>
        <mi>c</mi>
        </msub>
      </mfrac>
    </mrow>
  </mfrac>
</math>
 and any frequency before that is buffered (input signal = output signal). If we do a logarithm on these 2 sections we see that the gain of 1 becomes 0dB and the the second one becomes <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

. From this we can see that if the frequency scale is also logarithmic then the graph is combination of different straight lines.

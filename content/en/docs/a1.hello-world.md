## Algebra
Algebra is one of the first things we learn in secondary school maths and it lays the groundwork for more advanced maths. Engineers often try to avoid pages of algebra and try to use logic and reasoning instead, but at a certain point we will need numbers. When designing a clock generator, I was always putting together simple algebraic equtions to give me a rough idea of what transistor values would give me maximum efficiency and minimum sizes. 

A clock is the heartbeat of a chip and helps us ensure that different processes happen in the right order. Unlike the clocks we use to tell time, a clock generator can be pretty simple — it just switches between on and off states. Each time it switches on, it triggers the next step in a sequence.

[![alt text](algebra1f.png)]()  <!-- needs some improvements -->
There are 2 logic paths on the left and they are merged into 1 on the right. If we did a direct connection then the shorter path would give us a result before the short path which could lead to incorrect values being outputted from the logic block on the right. We use latches or flip-flops to make sure that new values are not sent to the next logic block until the clock goes high where the clock frequency is set so that both logic paths have completed.

To create a clock with a specific frequency (how fast it turns on and off), we can use a capacitor. A capacitor acts like a battery; the more current you give it, the faster it charges. This behavior is described by the equation <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

In reality, the capacitor is implemented using another transistor and the capacitance of a transistor is approximately <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

.

[![alt text](/docs/../algebra2.png)]()

When we put all these equations together, we find that if the capacitor and the transistor are the same type and size, changing their widths doesn’t affect the final clock frequency. This is great because we can use the lengths to set the frequency and the widths can be adjusted to minimize the impact of real life variations like noise. Noise is random fluctuations in current caused by the random movement of electrons that would mess with our clock frequency.

## Quadratics
These come up when designing filters, antennas, control systems and all other kinds of things. 

Filters and Resonators
A filter is a component that stops signals of certain frequency from passing through. It is one of the most basic things in electronics and is used in everything from sound systems to 5G communication. . One common type is the low-pass filter, which allows low frequencies to pass while blocking higher ones. It’s made up of a resistor and a capacitor. At low frequencies, the capacitor resists current flow, so the output voltage is similar to the input. But as the frequency increases, the capacitor allows more current to pass, reducing the output voltage.

[![alt text](/docs/algebra4a.png)]()


[![alt text](/docs/algebra5.png)]()


We can use the equations above to design a special type of filter called a resonator and this is the basic principle of how antennas work. When we connect  a resistor, capacitor and inductor in series, we see that energy will oscillate between the capacitor and the inductor. This is because the capacitor has to charge up before it can discharge through the inductor which then causes the inductor to charge up. When the input signal is at a specific frequency, the resistance of the capacitor and inductor is at a minimum which means that the current flowing through the circuit maximises and we get the graph below.

</math>. 

We usually don't need to solve this equation, but the discriminant helps us determine if our circuit acts as a resonator or a bandpass filter. We know that our system has to oscillate for all of this to work which means that for our circuit to be a resonator, our discriminant must be less than 0. This comes from the fact that if the roots are complex then the system can oscillate but we won't go into too much detail about that for now. 

LC values are fixed for the frequency we want to transmit or receive as the resistance minimises when the capacitor and inductor have the same resistance so <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

We can reduce this resistor if we want to transmit or receive a smaller number of frequencies (reduce our bandwidth) but have a much stronger signal for those frequencies (increase antenna range). For instance, if we were designing an antenna for satellite communication the frequency band is very small so we would want to reduce the resistor so that we get maximum range whereas bluetooth is very short range but we want high bandwidth as multiple devices might be connected to one mobile phone and then we can use different frequencies for separation.

<!-- *Bluetooth separation image* -->

Control Systems
This is the area where solving quadratics becomes useful. A control system are essential for ensuring that a system can maintain a specific output regardless of external conditions. A classic example of this is cruise control, where the car maintains a fixed speed. It does this by measuring the current speed of the car and then accelerating if the car is too slow or decelerating if the car is going too fast. This is called negative feedback where we detect the output, put it through another system and subtract it from the input so that the system reacts in the opposite direction to the current output.

Sometimes negative feedback can become positive feedback (subtracting a negative number is equivalent to an addition) and this causes a snowball effect where an increase in the input causes an increase in the output. We can use quadratics to prevent this from happening as control systems are modelled using something called transfer functions. When you multiply your transfer function and your input signal together, the output of the multiplication is approximately what you would get out of your control system.

When we solve this quadratic, we are actually finding the solutions of a differential equation. This means that if the roots are positive, then the system is unstable. The reason behind this is hard to explain at the moment as it requires understanding of complex numbers, differential equations and exponentials (negative roots correspond to decaying terms that settle to a certain value). 

[![alt text](/docs/algebra10.png)]()

We are going to go back to our clock generator example as we can use a control system there to ensure that our clock frequency stays constant. The clock generator control loop would be made up of 3 parts - a sensor, a filter and an oscillator. The sensor would compare the output frequency with the value we want and produce a voltage that is proportional to the difference between them. The filter would take the sensor output and remove any high frequency components that could cause instability and the oscillator would be the part we talked about in the algebra section which would produce a frequency proportional to the input voltage. All this comes together to give us the transfer function: 

[![alt text](/docs/algebra11.png)]()

We would then use the quadratic formula to find the roots of the denominator which gives -

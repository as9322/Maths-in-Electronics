Trigonometry is a huge topic in electronics engineering. It is the backbone for a lot of important principles in communications, signal processing and power systems.
## Fourier Transform
One of the most useful concepts is that any signal is a sum of sines and cosines of different frequencies. The is a bit abstract but if we think about it like this: we can use x and y to represent a whole 2D plane as we cannot multiply x by any number to get y. The same is true with sines and cosines, there is no number we can multiply cosine by to make sine so together they can act as building blocks for more complex signals. If you then start changing the amplitude (height), phase (delay) and frequency (repetitions) of the signal, you get to a point where any signal can be  represented. We can use something called a fourier transform to break down any signal in time into this sum.

The fourier transform is quite complicated as it requires understanding of integration and complex numbers but the graphs that we get from it are quite easy to understand. We can then plot this on a frequency plot and get something similar to the image below. This is extremely useful in audio processing as we can take the fourier transform of the audio recording and then clean up the signal by removing unwanted frequencies using filters (capacitors and inductors can be used to block certain frequencies as we saw in the Algebra section).

We can see from the image above that the highest peaks are in the range of 50-60Hz and there are more moderate peaks from 60-220Hz. THe 50-60Hz peaks probably correspond to oscillations caused by AC supply. All the recording equipment is probably powered by mains and in the UK the frequency of the mains signal is 50-60Hz which can be added to the recorded signal due to the various paths that exist within the circuitry. W could actually remove this by creating a digital filter that removes all frequencies below 60Hz which would then give us a cleaner track. 

## Communications
A common case where we work with Trigionometric functions and identities is in communications. If we take the example of a radio transmission, the station will be transmitting a sound signal which has a frequency of anywhere between 20Hz-20kHz. These are quite low frequencies so to transmit and receive them efficiently we need large antenna sizes. 
For a 20kHz signal we would need a 3500m antenna (3x10^8 / 20k = 15000m -> 15000/4 = 3500m) which is just impossible to make. We can fix this problem by doing 2 things:
 - Increasing the carrier frequency
 - Putting an inductor in series with the antenna 


From what I said in the Algebra section you might be wondering why not just use an inductor and the reason is that they are not as efficient as antennas. Inductors are designed to store energy rather than radiate it like an antenna. In the simple case from before it was easier to explain the fundamental concept without the additional complexity of the antenna. 

For this reason we superimpose these sound signals onto a higher carrier frequency. This is done by multiplying our message function <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mi>m</mi>
  <mo>(</mo>
  <mi>t</mi>
  <mo>)</mo>
</math> by the carrier which will be <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mo>cos</mo>
  <mo>(</mo>
  <mi>w</mi>
  <mo>&#8290;</mo> <!-- This is the multiplication sign -->
  <mi>t</mi>
  <mo>)</mo>
</math>
 to give <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mi>m</mi>
  <mo>(</mo>
  <mi>t</mi>
  <mo>)</mo>
  <mo>&#8290;</mo> <!-- This is the multiplication sign -->
  <mo>cos</mo>
  <mo>(</mo>
  <mi>w</mi>
  <mo>&#8290;</mo> <!-- This is the multiplication sign -->
  <mi>t</mi>
  <mo>)</mo>
</math>
. As we talked about at the beginning, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mi>m</mi>
  <mo>(</mo>
  <mi>t</mi>
  <mo>)</mo>
</math>
can be broken down into a sum of cosines (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mi>sin</mi>
  <mo>(</mo>
  <mi>&theta;</mi>
  <mo>)</mo>
  <mo>=</mo>
  <mi>cos</mi>
  <mo>(</mo>
  <mi>&theta;</mi>
  <mo>&#8722;</mo> <!-- This is the minus sign -->
  <mo>90</mo>
  <mo>&#176;</mo> <!-- This is the degree symbol -->
  <mo>)</mo>
</math>
) so when we multiply <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mi>m</mi>
  <mo>(</mo>
  <mi>t</mi>
  <mo>)</mo>
</math> by the carrier, we get:

[![alt text](../btrig7.png)]()

The high frequency term can be removed by a low pass filter so that we only transmit at one frequency and as we can see the message is encoded within the amplitude of the signal. 

[![alt text](../btrig5.png)]()

The magic comes on the receiver side. 

[![alt text](../btrig6.png)]()

To decode this on our radio, we multiply by the carrier frequency cosine again (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mo>cos</mo>
  <mo>(</mo>
  <mi>w</mi>
  <mi>c</mi>
  <mo>&#8290;</mo> <!-- This is the multiplication sign -->
  <mi>t</mi>
  <mo>)</mo>
</math>
) which gives:

[![alt text](../btrig9.png)]()

(cos even signal so -wm = wm) so output after lowpass filtering again is 

[![alt text](../btrig8.png)]()

which is exactly a quarter of our original message signal so can be easily corrected using a x4 amplifier. 


In electronics, sines and cosines are mainly used as signals rather than the more geometric view we have of them when studying them during A-Levels. This geometric side comes into play more in mechanical and civil engineering but as we have seen, the identites and algebra side of trigonometry is very useful in electronics.
